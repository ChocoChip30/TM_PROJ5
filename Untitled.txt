OCR Python
Optical character recognition
Converting text in images to raw text

We convert the image into numerical arrays that can then be parsed by the OCR system to get the text


Tesseract from Google
Not going to work for handwritten documents

Workflow fro OCR problems
Depends a little on type and quality of document
PIL (pillow) = open an image
OpenCV = change an image. Manipulate the image, extract bits of it, binarize it, grayscale it. So that the model can perform better, as it now will work with lesser data (no color)
Tesseract(PyTesseract) = OCR an image.
